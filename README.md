# Weather-in-African-Cities
 ## Project Overview
This project visualizes **real-time weather data** for **54 African capital cities** using **Power BI** connected to the **OpenWeather REST API**.  
It analyzes temperature, humidity, pressure, visibility, and wind patterns to explore Africa’s diverse climatic conditions.

##  Key Features
- Real-time data connection from OpenWeather API  
- Regional grouping by North, East, West, Central & Southern Africa  
- Comparative visuals: temperature, humidity, and visibility  
- Interactive map of all African capitals  

---

##  Analytical Questions
- How do temperatures vary across African regions?  
- Is there a relationship between temperature and humidity?  
- Which weather types are most common (Clear, Clouds, Rain, Mist)?  
- What is the correlation between humidity and visibility?
